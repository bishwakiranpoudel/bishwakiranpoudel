### üìù **Research Papers**  
üìö I am passionate about research and have authored the following papers (both under review):  

1. **Comparative Evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks: Kidney Abnormality Detection in CT Scans with Transfer Learning and Advanced Optimization**  
   - **Summary:**  
     This study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models like DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B1, and ResNet50 for detecting kidney abnormalities in CT scans. Transfer learning and advanced optimization techniques such as Mixup and label smoothing were applied. EfficientNet-B1 achieved **perfect scores across all metrics** while maintaining low computational overhead.  

  

2. **Identifying Novel Candidate Biomarkers for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: A Multi-Model Machine Learning Approach Highlights GUCA2A, SCARB2, and ZNF91**  
   - **Summary:**  
     Leveraging transcriptomic data, this study employs machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost to identify novel biomarkers for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Key genes such as **GUCA2A, SCARB2, and ZNF91** were highlighted as potential diagnostic markers, offering fresh insights into PCD pathogenesis.
